# NHS Performance analysis

#### Reason for project
To enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights into emergency room performance and 
to enable stakeholders to track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding patient management and service optimization.

#### Problem statement
* What is the gender and race distribution ?
* What is the average patient satisfaction score?
* What is the admission rate (%) of patients visiting?
* Which departments receive the most referrals?
* Are there trends in patient admissions by time of day, week, or month?
* What is the average patient satisfaction score?
* How does waiting time impact patient satisfaction?
* Are there certain departments with lower satisfaction scores?
* What are the peak hours or days when hospital visits are highest?

#### Key Insights and recomendations
###### Key Insights for Hospital Management
* Total Patient Records: 9,216 cases analysed.
* Average Patient Wait Time: 35.26 minutes, which may indicate room for improvement in patient flow management.
* Patient Satisfaction Score: 4.99/10, which suggests potential dissatisfaction among patients.
* Overall Admission Rate: 50.04%, meaning about half of the hospital visitors require hospitalization.

  ###### Recomendations
* Implement a triage optimization system to prioritize critical cases effectively.
* Increase staffing during peak hours based on admission trends.
* Enhance digital queue management to improve patient experience.
* Address factors contributing to dissatisfaction (e.g., waiting times, communication).
* Implement a real-time feedback system to track patient concerns.
* Conduct training programs for staff on patient interaction and empathy.
* Analyze department-specific referrals to identify where congestion occurs.
* Improve coordination with general practitioners to avoid unnecessary  visits.
* Expand telehealth services for non-critical cases to reduce  overload.
